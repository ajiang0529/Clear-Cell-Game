# Clear-Cell-Game

Project with implemenation of Java and Java Swing. Designed a game where the user clicks/clears clusters of the same color squares while
they fall down. Inheritance was used to link the Game.java class and ClearCellGame.java class, and the design revolved around the
use of 2D arrays filled with Boardcell enums. Java Swing was utilized to create a gui for the game: falling block animation, different
colored blocks, generation of clusters, prevention of alternating colored block layers, score, game over message, and pop-ups that prompt
the user to input number of rows, columns, and fall rate.
